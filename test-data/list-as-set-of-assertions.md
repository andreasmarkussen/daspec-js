#Lists can be a set of assertions

##These prove I know arithmetic
* Simple arithmetic: 2 plus 2 is 4
* Simple arithmetic: 2 plus 3 is 5
* Simple arithmetic: 3 plus 3 is 5
* List can contain sub lists
  - Simple arithmetic: 2 plus 2 is 4

> These prove I know arithmetic too
- Simple arithmetic: 2 plus 2 is 4
- Simple arithmetic: 2 plus 3 is 5
- Simple arithmetic: 3 plus 3 is 5

###These prove I know arithmetic in order
1. Simple arithmetic: 2 plus 2 is 4
11. Simple arithmetic: 2 plus 3 is 5
101. Simple arithmetic: 3 plus 3 is 5

<!--OUTPUT
